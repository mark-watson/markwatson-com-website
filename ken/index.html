    <h1>Ken Watson Celebration of Life</h1>
    <p>My Dad Kenneth Watson was a Physics professor at UC Berkeley.</p>
    <p>My Dad had a passion for boating. We sailed between San Francisco and San Diego many times when I was a teenager and in my early 20s.</p>
    <p>After retiring Dad taught himself 3D animation and video editing and he enjoyed writing screen plays and getting friends and family to do voices for animated characters.</p>
