    <section id="consulting">
      <h1>Remote Consulting Services</h1>
      <p><i>While I have been working as a remote consultant since 1998 I also work onsite as required at higher consulting rates.</i></p>
      <p>I offer both priority consulting services ($100/hour) and also non-priority services ($50/hour). Priority customers get regularly scheduled on-site meetings for local customers, video meetings and firm delivery schedules. For travel to customer sites for priority consulting services, customer pays reasonable transportation and hotel costs. Non-priority services are better if I am acting as an advisor on projects and strategic planning where most interactions are asynchronous email and code exchanges with flexible and non-priority delivery schedules. There might be a day or two delay in processing work requests under a non-priortity work agreement.</p>
