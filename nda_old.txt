Between Mark Watson (a limited liability CONSULTANT) and the CUSTOMER: ____________________________________

1. The CONSULTANT agrees to make his best effort in performing work for the CUSTOMER. The CONSULTANT expects the CUSTOMER to assign work tasks (for example: software design, coding, mentoring, and documentation) using email while the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER are working together. The CONSULTANT maintains a detailed daily work log that is provided to the CUSTOMER. CONSULTANT will make reasonable efforts to deliver defect-free coding. If any defects are found in any code written by the CONSULTANT for the CUSTOMER, then CONSULTANT will make reasonable efforts to fix any defects and the CUSTOMER pays for this new work at the CONSULTANT's current hourly rate. The intention of both the CONSULTANT and the CUSTOMER is to work together in a flexible way at the direction of the CUSTOMER. The agreement between CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER is an "at will" agreement, cancelable by the CUSTOMER at any time and cancelable by the CONSULTANT given a one week notice.

2. The CUSTOMER owns all rights to software that the CONSULTANT develops for the CUSTOMER once the CUSTOMER has paid the CONSULTANT for the work. This excludes any 3rd party software components that are used (either commercial components provided by the CUSTOMER or any freely available open source or public domain software that the CUSTOMER and CONSULTANT agree to use). If the CONSULTANT uses existing Open Source software written by the CONSULTANT then the CUSTOMER has rights to use the included software under the Open Source License's terms. If CONSULTANT incorporates prior work owned by CONSULTANT (not Open Source) into work developed for CUSTOMER, then the CUSTOMER is considered to have a free use unrestricted license and rights to use such work upon receipt of agreed payment, without affecting CONSULTANT's pre-existing rights in the work.

3. Both the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER agree that the CONSULTANT functions as a limited liability consultant: the CONSULTANT's legal liability for any individual task is limited to the amount of money paid to the CONSULTANT to perform that task. In case of inadvertent disclosure of CUSTOMER's proprietary information (paragraph 4) CONSULTANT'S maximum liability is five times the fee paid to consultant for performing work on the tasks for CUSTOMER that involved the use of inadvertently disclosed proprietary information.

4. CONSULTANT agrees to hold CUSTOMER's proprietary information in strict confidence and will make all reasonable efforts to not disclose any proprietary information to any third party. Proprietary information includes any technical and business information that is not in the public domain or common knowledge. Both the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER agree to take all reasonable precautions for safeguarding each others intellectual property. This paragraph has the following exception for projects developed under an open source software license: software developed will be released publicly, but, details of the CUSTOMER's business will remain confidential. CUSTOMER agrees to only furnish data, access to databases, and code with CONSULTANT that they have the rights and authorization to share with CONSULTANT.

5. Both the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER understand that in any project there is some legal risk of infringing on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right held by any third party. The CUSTOMER accepts any liability for infringing on third party property right for any work the CONSULTANT performs for the CUSTOMER. The CONSULTANT will work with the CUSTOMER to avoid any infringement of third party property rights. When working for the CUSTOMER, the CONSULTANT agrees to not use any working materials or algorithms that he knows infringe on third party property rights.

6. The CUSTOMER agrees to pay the CONSULTANT's invoices promptly (within 7 days of invoice) on receipt. A delay in payment will result in a suspension of work activities until payment is received. MINIMUM WEEKLY BILLING FOR REMOTE PROJECTS: long term remote projects will be billed at a minimum of 5 hours per week.

7. Upon termination of this agreement and at CUSTOMER's request, or at any time at CUSTOMER's request, (i) CONSULTANT shall at CUSTOMER's expense promptly return or deliver to CUSTOMER and/or destroy all materials containing or constituting proprietary information, including any software developed by CONSULTANT for CUSTOMER (and paid for per this agreement) and any copies and extracts thereof and (ii) CONSULTANT shall not use such proprietary information in any way for any purpose. CONSULTANT does maintain a permanent copy of the text (but not attachments) of all emails with CUSTOMER and work logs.

8. Upon termination of work performed by CONSULTANT for the CUSTOMER, both CUSTOMER and CONSULTANT agree that the terms of this agreement remain in effect. This includes protecting intellectual property of the other party. In case of dispute governing law is assumed to be that of the state of California.

9. If a provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement.
